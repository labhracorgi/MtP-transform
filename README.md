# MtP-transform

This repository contains a general implementation of "Multinomial to poisson" transformation.
The transformation's intended usage is to transform a dataframe such that the transformed data can be used to perform multinomial regression through the method Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA).

See: http://www.r-inla.org/

The exact formula specification is also provided.

See the ____ for the exact details about how it works.

The general implementation was inspired by Martin Zuba's example linked in the following Google groups thread:
