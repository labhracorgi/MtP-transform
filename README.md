# Multinomial-to-Poisson-transform

This repository contains a general implementation of "Multinomial to poisson" transformation.
The transformation's intended usage is to transform a dataframe such that the transformed data can be used to perform multinomial regression through the method Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA).

See http://www.r-inla.org/ for more information about INLA.

The exact formula specification is also provided.

See the ____ for the exact details about how it works.

The general implementation was inspired by the example Martin Zuba provided in the following Google groups thread:
